His early love for cricket saw him competing at the under-14 nationals, but his true calling lay in the seas. Driven by an unwavering aspiration to join the merchant navy from class 11, Ojas excelled through numerous sponsorship exams and interviews with esteemed companies such as Anglo Eastern, Torm Tankers, and Fleet Management. Despite clearing the NDA written exams, his focus remained steadfast on maritime adventures. He honed his skills at Tolani Maritime Institute, eventually selecting Torm Tankers for his DNS

Partnering with Shahnawaz, Ojas founded Budding Mariners, and over the past three years, he has successfully trained and sponsored over 1,500+ seafarers for various shipping companies, leaving an indelible mark on the maritime industry.`,
